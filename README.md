## Final project of "Fundamentals" course

This is the final project of the fundamentals course of The Odin Project's curriculum.

This project is a way of practicing everything I've learned these last few months that I've been
following the Odin Project's web dev curriculum. As such, I will refer to my knowledge of HTML, CSS, 
Javascript, Git, and DOM manipulation to create an interactive calculator complete with an UI and 
various basic functions.
